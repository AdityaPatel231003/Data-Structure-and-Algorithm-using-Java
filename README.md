PROGRAMS-->A set of instructions that you give to a computer so that it will do a particular task is a program.

PATTERN--> We use for and while loop to print various pattern.

METHODS--> If a function is part of an instance of a class i.e. (Object) <br>
then it is called method else it is called function.

SEARCHING-->A searching algorithm is a step-by-step procedure <br>
used to locate a specific element within a data structure, such as an array or a list.<br>
Searching algorithms play a crucial role in programming, as they enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

ARRAY--> An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. <br>
The length of an array is established when the array is created.<br>
After creation, its length is fixed.

SORTING-->The process of arranging data elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, based on a set of criteria. 

2D ARRAY --> It includes rows and column there could be N-D array on the basis of recuriment .Memory/Address is not in contigious fashion 2D array divides individually in n number of 1D array based on number of rows.
             Size of 2D array is n*m
            <br> Example:- 1) To store marks of different subject of 50 Students
                           2)  3D Image Processing and 4D video processing

STRINGS=>An object that represents a number of character values is called String. <br>
         They are immutable can be mutable by StringBuilder and StringBuffer


OOPS --> Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like  Encapsulations, inheritance, Abstraction polymorphism in programming.

RECURSION --> Recursion is method to solve computational problem by dividing the problem and the solution of the problem is depend on the solution of smaller instances of the same problem.

Divide and Conquer --> Merge Sort and Quick Sort 

Backtracking --> It involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.
                 types - 1)Decision 2) optimization 3)Enumeration

ArrayList --> Linear Data Structure and Java Collection Framework.  
             | Array  | ArrayList |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Static Memory  | Dynamic Memory  |
| Primitive Data can be store  | Primitive Data can not be store  |

         Implementing MultiDimensionalarrayList ---> ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> mainlist =new ArrayList<>();   
                                                     ArrayList<Integer> list1 =new ArrayList<>();              
                                                     ArrayList<Integer> list2 =new ArrayList<>();      
  | mainlist ->   | list1  | list2 |
   | -------------              | ------------- | ------------- |
