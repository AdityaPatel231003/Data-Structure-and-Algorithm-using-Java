**My java learning**

**PROGRAMS:** <p>A set of instructions that you give to a computer so that it will do a particular task is a program.</p>

**PATTERN:** <p> We use for and while loop to print various pattern.</p>

**METHODS:**  <p>If a function is part of an instance of a class i.e. (Object) then it is called method else it is called function.</p>

**SEARCHING:** <p>A searching algorithm is a step-by-step procedure used to locate a specific element within a data structure, such as an array or a list. Searching algorithms play a crucial role in programming, as they enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation.</p>



**ARRAY:** <p>An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.</p>

**SORTING:** <p>The process of arranging data elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, based on a set of criteria.</p>

**2D ARRAY:** <p> It includes rows and column there could be N-D array on the basis of recuriment. Memory/Address is not in contigious fashion 2D array divides individually in n number of 1D array based on number of rows. Size of 2D array is n*m<br>
             Example:- 1) To store marks of different subject of 50 Students
                          <br> 2)  3D Image Processing and 4D video processing</p>

**STRINGS:** <p> An object that represents a number of character values is called String. They are immutable can be mutable by StringBuilder and StringBuffer</p>

        

**OOPS:** <p> Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like  Encapsulations, inheritance, Abstraction polymorphism in programming.</p>

**RECURSION:** <p> Recursion is method to solve computational problem by dividing the problem and the solution of the problem is depend on the solution of smaller instances of the same problem.</p>

**Divide and Conquer:** <p> Merge sort and quick sort </p>

**Backtracking:** <p> It involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.
                 Types:- 1)Decision 2) optimization 3)Enumeration</p>

**ArrayList:** <p> Linear data structure and java collection framework.  
             | Array  | ArrayList |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Static Memory  | Dynamic Memory  |
| Primitive Data can be store  | Primitive Data can not be store  |

         Implementing MultiDimensionalarrayList ---> ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> mainlist =new ArrayList<>();   
                                                     ArrayList<Integer> list1 =new ArrayList<>();              
                                                     ArrayList<Integer> list2 =new ArrayList<>();      
  | mainlist ->   | list1  | list2 |
   | -------------              | ------------- | ------------- |
   </p>

**LINKED_LIST:** <p> Linear data structure and in which memory is dynamic.Contains node which is originally the object. Two parts of node:- data and next(reference variable).</p>


**STACK:** <p> Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). <br>
            Uses:- Valid Paranathesis,Max Area in Histogram
                        | Operation  | Time and Space Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| push() | O(1)  |
| pop()  | O(1)  |
| peek() | O(1)  |
| isEmpty()  | O(1)  |
</p>

**Queue:** <p> A Queue is a linear data structure. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).<br>
            Types of Queues:- <br> 1) Simple Queue <br> 2) Circular Queue <br> 3) Priority Queue <br> 4)  Dequeue <br>
            Uses:- TicketCounter,Job Schedulling <br>
            Disadvantage:- 1) Searching an element takes O(N) time.<br>
            2) The operations such as insertion and deletion of elements from the middle are time consuming. <br>
            3) Maximum size of a queue must be defined prior in case of array implementation.  
 | LinkedLists Class  | ArrayDequeue Class |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Implements queue and list | Implements dequeue  |
| accessing specific index is possible in O(n)  | accessing specific index is  not possible  |
| allows null elements |  Doesn't allows null elements  |
| More memory due to overhead storing of references   | Memory Efficient |
